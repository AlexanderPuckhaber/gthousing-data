# gthousing-data

The purpose of this project is to web-scrape data from [http://housing.gatech.edu/rooms/FreeRooms.json?](http://housing.gatech.edu/rooms/FreeRooms.json?) using GitHub Actions.

I just followed this tutorial: [https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/](https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/)
