# gthousing-data

The purpose of this project is to web-scrape data from [http://housing.gatech.edu/rooms/FreeRooms.json?](http://housing.gatech.edu/rooms/FreeRooms.json?) using GitHub Actions.

I just followed this tutorial: [https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/](https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/)

Data goes to the [/data/F21-S22/](/data/F21-S22/) folder. The timestamps are unix timestamps; see the commit messages for the timezone.

Also, the latest json file is put here: [/data/F21-S22/latest/latest.json](/data/F21-S22/latest/latest.json)
